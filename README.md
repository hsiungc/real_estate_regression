<h1>Real Estate and Luxury Features</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In recent years, the rise of instant buying has become a phenomenon amongst the likes of RedFin, Opendoor, and Trulia. iBuyers rely on mass amounts of real estate data to make cash offers on homes, only to flip properties within a few months. The nature of the industry calls for quick, high-volume turnovers to account for narrow margins. Due to the risk involved in this process, our team (names removed for privacy) will identify the value-adds that increase property sales price. The following question will guide the research:</p>

<p>Do U.S.-based real estate properties with specific intrinsic and luxury features command a listing price premium?</p>

<p>The research methodology is broken down into the following: data sanitization, partitioning and feature extraction, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building & tuning, summary analysis and validation of out-of-sample results.</p>
